## Introduction 
I watched TED: Simon Sinek [How great leaders inspire action](http://my.tv.sohu.com/pl/5495164/57708471.shtml) over weekend. The key idea is called golden circle as below, which tell us to communicate from inside out: why, how and what. This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.

##Golden circle:Why? How? What? 
Why? How, What? This little idea explains why some organization and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Every signal person on the planet knows what they do. Some know how they do it. But very few people know why they do it. And "why" does not mean "to make a profit". That's a result. It's always a result. "Why" means: What's your purpose? What's your cause? What's your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care?   

## Why golden circle
Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Golden circle is inspiring in marketing, sales.  
## How golden circle works
When we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of compilicated information like features and benifits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out, we are talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from.  You know, sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right" Why would we use the verb, it desn't "feel" right. Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doens't control language. 
## What golden circle can help to do
Let's see how Apple apply golden circle. If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing from them might sound like this: "We make greate computer. They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?" And that's how most of us comunicate. That's how most marketing is done. that's how most sales is done and that's most of us communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that. Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has lether seats, buy our car. But it's uninspiring.   

Here's how Apple actually communicate. "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computer. Want to buy one?" Totally different, right? You are ready to buy a computer from me. All I did was reverse the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it. People don't buy what you do; They buy why you do it.
